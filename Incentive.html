                <!--THE IDEA-->  

                    <h3 class="projectH3">THE IDEA</h3>
                    <p class="projectP">My final design project of UX / UI in Ironhack Barcelona was inspirated in a coffee break, talking with two coworkers (Montse & Betty) about what we would do during the weekend. They explained me that they didn't knew any application that offered a varied leisure offer close in their towns, almost all the offer is in the capitals. They also explained that they found information about activities that had been organized in the nearness, but that they knew about these activities too late, when these were finished. <br>These activities could be exhibitions, outdoor activities, fairs, etc., and they were not announced because they were not commerce business. <br>How can i design a solution for this?</p>

                    <img src="assets/images/portfolio/Group.png" class="img" alt="Group">

                <!--THE PROBLEM-->  

                    <h3 class="projectH3">THE PROBLEM</h3>
                    <p class="projectP">The problem is that I did not have access to the information of those activities because many were not advertise beyond a board in the council house. I was also thinking about the Meetup events I attended and how much I have enriched myself with them (how do I get the information about these events?).
                    So, I thought I could create a platform where you could organize a plan and look for free time activities (supply and demand).This platform would allow the flow of advertising / information of free time activities, in which the user could be aware of the nearby activities that suit their preferences at the best. All close to there location or other locations the user would visit in future.</p>

                            <li>

                        The first thing I learned at Ironhack is to use the "Design thinking" methodology. This methodology focuses on developing innovative thinking and works especially for the people who will use it.
                         <ul class="project-list">
                            <li>I had a total of 83 <strong>surveys</strong> results in which:
                            <br>
                            48% of respondents reported that they did not always find activities according to their preferences and close activities.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I had 6 <strong>interviews</strong> in which:
                                <br>
                                The most recurrent words are <em>"closeness"</em> 50%, <em>"variety"</em> 33%, <em>“without advertising”</em> 50% and <em>“prices"</em> 16%.
                                All the people interviewed agreed that the weather was very important to choose an activity (indoor vs outdoor).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                        I filled a <b>Lean UX canvas</b> to identify the current business problems, goals, hypotheses and potential solutions.
                    </p>

                        Highlights of this UX lean canvas:
                         <ul class="project-list">
                            <li><b>Business outcomes:</b> Interest in local activities has increased. This has caused a benefit to the local business and cultural activities to be more relevant.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Hypothesis:</b> We believe that if we want to increase the local leisure activities booking, we can achieve it if the users have more information about the cultural activities nearby. With an application that helps the search of information and offers integrated booking and payment.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>What's the most important thing we need to learn first?</b> (This is the assumption that will cause the entire idea to fall if it's wrong): The DB is not updated because we don't motivate the organizers to publish in our app. Our app hasn't a good usability or is not attractive. The app doesn't facilitate booking and purchasing. Users don't use the app because they don't find any offer they like.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 20px;">And I needed to <b>empathize</b> with the users and walk with their shoes. To understand what they think, I made this empathy map.</p>

                        The conclusions were...

                            <li><b>Think and feel:</b> they would like more variety to be able to choose. Also, it would be great to be aware of the activities near their homes.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Hear:</b> <em>"It is boring to do always the same activities".</em>

                            <li><b>See:</b> Their friends have the same problem. The best offer is in the capitals. There are people who organize cool activities nearby, but they find out later.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Say and do:</b> They will be able to organize themselves if they know in advance any activity that really motivates them.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Pain:</b> Bored at home when they could be doing funny things.

                            <li><b>Gain:</b> To choose easily in a varied leisure activity offer. Be informed of the activities that are being organized near their homes.

                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Steps backwards:</b> As for UI, typography and colors took many tests and research to reach the best option. As for the structure of the sub-categories, make many tests with different menus and options up to find the most appropriate structure.</p>
                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Fail soon:</b> Card sorting: In the main flow (search and reserve an activity) the app had too many steps to complete the task and  it needed a more agile flow.</p>

                    <h3 class="projectH3">CONCLUSIONS AND LEARNING</h3>
                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 10px;">The part that was most easy for me was the UX process. The research and the conclusions I reached made it easier for me a solid basis to start designing the application.</p>
                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 10px;"><b> Insightful failure:</b> In the case of the user interface, it was difficult for me to renounce my first selection typographies. Testing with users leads me to the conclusion that these typographies were not appropriate for the target audience.</p>
                    <p class="projectP" style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>If I would start again,</b> I would make the UI decisions from the user's point of view instead of my own preferences. I became aware that I was not the user and that I should continue with the flow that testing gave me. As in the UX I was sure that the whole UI process had to be focused on the user. I have more strengths in UX and I still have a long way to learn in UI.</p>
